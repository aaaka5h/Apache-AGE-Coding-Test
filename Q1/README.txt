Dev environment and how to compile and run source code:

The source code for Question 1 is in C and was created on VSCode. To run the source code, simply compile the file Q1.c and run it with a command line argument n. The value that will be printed to your console will be the nth fibonnaci number.

For example on my Mac, I can compile the file by typing: gcc Q1.c -o Q1.exe into my terminal and get the 4th fibonnaci number by running: ./Q1.exe 4. Just make sure you are in the proper directory!
